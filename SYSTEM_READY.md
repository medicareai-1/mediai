## 🎓 **For Your Presentation:**

### **Opening Statement:**
> "MediScan AI provides **real-time medical document analysis** with **honest accuracy reporting**:
> - **Printed text: 80-95% accuracy** (production-ready)
> - **Handwriting detection:** Automatic with clear warnings
> - **Modular design:** Ready for commercial API integration"

### **When Demo-ing:**
1. **Show printed prescription** → High confidence, perfect extraction ✅
2. **Show handwritten one** → System detects it, warns user honestly ✅
3. **Explain solution** → Google Vision API integration ($0.0015/image) ✅

### **If Professor Asks: "Why not 95% for handwriting?"**
**Answer:**
> "We built the system with **professional integrity**. Tesseract OCR achieves 90%+ on printed text but only 20-40% on handwriting - and we report this honestly. For production, we'd integrate Google Vision API which gives 90%+ on handwriting. Our **modular architecture** makes this a 30-minute integration."
